This repository contains a MATLAB function demonstrating an uncommon error related to conditional logic and potential implicit type conversion. The function `myFunction` calculates the square of a number if it is greater than 5 and adds 10 otherwise.  However, due to unexpected operator precedence or implicit type conversions, this code might produce unexpected results under certain conditions. The `bug.m` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version.
